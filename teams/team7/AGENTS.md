# AGENTS.md — Team 7 (Chat with Coach + Reserve Coach)

> **Audience:** AI coding agents (and humans) who will work in this folder.
> **Owners:** Sina Sadeghi (lead), Sina Negahban, Amirali Rahimi. Group 7.
>
> The detailed plan, decisions, and checklists live in
> [`.agents/`](./.agents/) — start with `.agents/README.md`, then read
> `00_team_overview.md` and `02_architecture_decisions.md` before touching
> code.

## 1. What this folder is

We are building **two microservices** for the PolyLife platform:

- **Chat with Coach** — real-time text chat between a user and a coach
  (WebSocket, presence, typing indicators, attachments).
- **Reserve Coach** — book a coaching session from a coach's published
  availability slots, plus a 1–5 rating system.

Both services share the same FastAPI backend container but live in separate
routers (`/api/chat/...` and `/api/reserve/...`).

## 2. Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Backend | **FastAPI** (Python 3.12) | Non-Django, async, Pydantic validation, auto OpenAPI. |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.x (async) + Alembic | Migrations, FK, JSONB. |
| DB | PostgreSQL 16 | Per-repo convention; env vars in `.env.example`. |
| Cache / pub-sub | Redis 7 | Chat fan-out across workers, rate limiting. |
| Transport (chat) | WebSocket | Real-time push required by P1. |
| Tests | pytest + httpx + pytest-asyncio | Standard for FastAPI. |
| Gateway | Nginx (template provided) | `auth_request` forward-auth to Core. |

**Forbidden** by the PDF: editing the top-level `requirements.txt`,
`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, or `settings.py`. All deps go into
`teams/team7/backend/requirements.txt` (created in Sprint 1).

## 3. Folder layout (target after Sprint 1)

## 4. Hard rules (read first, then code)

1. **Never decode JWTs.** Trust the `X-User-Id` and `X-User-Username`
   headers that the gateway forwards. See
   `.agents/02_architecture_decisions.md` §1 for the exact flow.
2. **Never touch the top-level `requirements.txt`, `Dockerfile`,
   `docker-compose.yml`, or `settings.py`.** PDF §۳.۳ forbids it.
3. **All env vars come from `.env`** (auto-copied from `.env.example` on
   first run by `run.sh`). Don't hardcode URLs or secrets.
4. **All DB tables have** `id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `is_deleted`
   columns. snake_case, English, descriptive names. Indexed on filtered
   columns. FK between related tables.
5. **Commit message format:** `<gitmoji> [team7] <verb>: <description>` —
   see `.agents/07_git_workflow.md` §3.
6. **Branch names:** `feature/team-7-<scope>-<short>`,
   `bugfix/team-7-<short>`, `docs/team-7-<topic>`. PRs target
   `feature` or `development` only (not `main`).
7. **Never `git push -f`.** The PDF bans it; merge conflicts must be
   resolved manually.

## 5. Running locally

```bash
# 0. Add upstream once per clone (only if your clone doesn't have it)
git remote add upstream git@github.com:PolyLife2026/PolyLife.git

# 1. Always pull upstream before starting
git pull upstream main

# 2. Start the core (must be up before any team)
scripts/bash/start-core.sh

# 3. Start this team
scripts/bash/start-team.sh 7

# 4. Open http://localhost:9107  (you should see the gateway placeholder)
```

For shell-style live logs of our backend:
```bash
cd teams/team7
docker compose logs -f backend
```

For an interactive shell in our backend container:
```bash
docker compose exec backend bash
```

## 6. How an agent should use this repo

1. **Read first:**
   - `.agents/00_team_overview.md` (who we are, what we're building)
   - `.agents/02_architecture_decisions.md` (the "why" behind every choice)
   - `.agents/03_database_design.md` (the schema)
   - `.agents/04_api_endpoints.md` (the contracts)
2. **Pick a Jira ticket** (key prefix `SCRUM`, e.g. `SCRUM-7`). If none
   matches your task, **create one** in the
   `sinasadeghi83.atlassian.net` project.
3. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   `git checkout -b feature/team-7-<scope>-<short>`
4. **Make focused commits** with the gitmoji + `[team7]` format.
5. **Push daily** (PDF §زمان‌بندی Push کردن) and **at least 24 h before
   the deadline**. End every working session with a push.
6. **Open a PR to `feature` or `development`**, never to `main`.
7. **Before requesting review**, run the smoke test in
   `.agents/08_implementation_checklist.md` §G and paste the output.

## 7. Jira wiring (status as of 2026-07-19)

> **Status:** Jira site exists at `sinasadeghi83.atlassian.net` (Sina S.
> is site owner/admin). The Scrum project **`SE1 Team 7` (key `SCRUM`)** was
> created on 2026-07-19 via the Atlassian REST API. It is **next-gen /
> team-managed** (style verified via `GET /rest/api/3/project/SCRUM`).
>
> The Scrum board and the 18 Sprint 1 + Sprint 2 tickets listed in
> `.agents/06_task_assignment.md` §4–§5 will be created next. Until then,
> `.agents/06_task_assignment.md` is the source of truth.
>
> **Note (recovered from an earlier mistake):** an intermediate project
> `PolyLife — Team 7` with key `PL7` was briefly created and then deleted
> because the user clarified to use the pre-existing `SE1 Team 7` (key
> `SCRUM`) space. All ticket references in these docs now use `SCRUM`.

## 8. Open questions (resolve before coding the relevant ticket)

| # | Question | Owner | Blocking ticket |
|---|----------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Do we need a queue for offline-message delivery? | Sina N. | Sprint 2 chat backend |
| 2 | Do we use Redis Streams or RabbitMQ for events? | Sina S. | Sprint 2 chat backend |
| 3 | How do we surface coach availability across both services? | Amirali | Sprint 2 reserve backend |

> Add new questions here when they come up; resolve them in writing, not
> in DMs.

## 9. How an agent should update this file

- **When you make an architectural decision**, edit the relevant section
  in `.agents/02_architecture_decisions.md` and add a short note here
  pointing to it.
- **When you finish a sprint**, update the Jira status section above and
  the sprint backlogs in `.agents/06_task_assignment.md`.
- **When the stack changes** (e.g. we pick a different ORM), update §2
  here AND the corresponding section in
  `.agents/02_architecture_decisions.md`.
